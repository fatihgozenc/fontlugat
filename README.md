## A Simple Font Explorer
Fontlugat is a lightweight font explorer that collects all your fonts from selected folder and shows them in your browser. No font permissions or font activations like other programs. Just for showing fonts and testing them with different text content and font sizes.

### Supported Formats
It supports `.otf`, `.ttf`, `.woff`, `.woff2` and `.eot`.

### Dependencies
It uses [`walkdir`](https://docs.rs/walkdir/), [`open`](https://docs.rs/open/) and standard Rust library at the moment. There are no more planned dependencies at the moment.

### Thank you
For your interest. It's still in development but ready to use from terminal on Windows, MacOSX and Linux.

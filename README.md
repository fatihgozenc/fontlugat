# Fontlugat

## Simple Font Explorer
Fontlugat is a lightweight font displayer that lists all your fonts from selected folder and shows them in your browser. No font permissions or font activations like other libraries. Just for showing fonts and testing them with different text content.

### Supported Formats
It supports all well-known font formats except .pfb, .pfm and .suitcase.

### Dependencies
It only uses standard Rust library at the moment. There are no planned dependencies at the moment.
